# Welcome to Redux-Example Project

This project is an example of implementing the Redux-Example entities on the client side using React and Redux.

## Redux Entities

### 1. Configured React Router Dom

In this page you can see the Material Data Grid component which is rendering a client side array called books with custom row rendering based on each data field, where you can operate the full CRUD functionality such as add, edit and delete on the client side using local state.

### 2. Created Toggle functionality with Redux and local state

There are two routes for this entity to list all the users and have a deep review of each single user.

### 3. Created todo list functionality with Redux

In this page, you can see users loaded from [JSON Placeholder Users API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
And by clicking on each item, you would navigate to the single user page to see the full details of the selected user

### 4. Created simple fetching with local state

In this page, based on the id in the path parameter, you can see the user loaded from [JSON Placeholder Single User API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1)

### 5. Created Counter with Redux

In this page you can see the Material Data Grid component which is rendering a client side array called products
